Welcome
About me

Here’s what’s serverless
* don’t control the instance
* focus on the code
* gain advantages
* (event driven)
* FaaS

Here’s what it is not
* BaaS
* Spread parallel computing

How does AWS Lambda work?
* Event driven
* Supported languages
    * How to extend it
* Small API
* Free layer

Other vendors shortly

Higher level programming
* several serverless frameworks
* serverless framework
    * hello world
    * async and libs
    * deploy and partial deploy (cloud formation)
    * hello S3
    * hello DB
    * scheduled hello

Perfect use cases
* S3 images processing
* Chatbots
* Websites
* Log analysis on the fly
* Event Sourcing

Easy tools take over the world
* Greek and Romans?
* Lack of operations and system administration
* Lambda is to computing what S3 is to storage
* Two students re-done the service

Limitations
* Disk space
* Deployment package size
* Memory
* Time

Pain points
* Monitor usage
* Debugging
* Wall of requests hit AWS (doesn’t scale that well)
* Cost management

Biggest wins
* Scalability
* Pricing
* NoOps

Extras
* Serverlessify regular app (WSGI)
* Golem
